Available Meta states
---------------------

.. contents::
   :local:

``docker``
^^^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

This state installs the Docker solution (see https://docs.docker.io)
for Raspberry Pi support please see `Notes <https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/docker-formula/blob/master/docs/README.rst#notes-on-raspberry-pi-support>`_

``docker.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

Stop Docker daemon and remove docker packages ('docker', 'docker-engine', 'docker-ce', etc) on Linux. To protect OS integrity, this state won't remove packages listed as dependencies (i.e. python is kept).


``docker.software.package.repo``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configures the upstream Docker's repo on RedHat/Debian OS.

``docker.software.package.repo.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state removes upstream Docker package repository only, on RedHat/Debian OS.

``docker.software``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state installs Docker (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install and https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

``docker.software.service``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state installs Dockerd daemon on Linux (systemd support).

``docker.software.service.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state stops Dockerd daemon on Linux (systemd support).

``docker.software.config``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state overrides default Docker options (i.e. /etc/default/docker)::

  docker:
    pkg:
      docker:
        config:
          - DOCKER_OPTS="-s btrfs --dns 8.8.8.8"
          - export http_proxy="http://172.17.42.1:3128"


``docker.software.config.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state uninstalls Docker overrides (i.e. /etc/default/docker).

``docker.software.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state uninstalls Docker software.

``docker.containers``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pulls and runs a number of docker containers. See docker container API for docker.containers options::

  docker:
    containers:
      running:
        - prometheus_simple
        - prometheus_detail

      prometheus_simple:
        image: "prom/prometheus:v1.7.1"

      prometheus_detail:
        image: "prom/prometheus:v1.7.1"
        # see https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/containers.html


``docker.compose``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Saltstack `dockercompose module` state support (See https://docs.saltstack.com/en/2018.3/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.dockercompose.html).

``docker.compose.ng``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The intent is to provide an interface similar to the `specification <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/>`_
provided by docker-compose. The hope is that you may provide pillar data
similar to that which you would use to define services with docker-compose. The
assumption is that you are already using pillar data and salt formulae to
represent the state of your existing infrastructure.

No real effort had been made to support every possible feature of
docker-compose.  Rather, we prefer the syntax provided by the docker-compose
whenever it is reasonable for the sake of simplicity.

It is worth noting that we have added one attribute which is decidedly absent
from the docker-compose specification. That attribute is ``dvc``. This is a
boolean attribute which allows us to define data only volume containers
which can not be represented with the ``docker.software.service.running`` state
since they are not intended to include a long living service inside the
container.

See the included ``pillar.example`` for a representative pillar data block.
To use this formula, you might target a host with the following pillar:

.. code:: yaml

    docker:
      compose:
        ng:
          registry-datastore:
            dvc: true
            # image: &registry_image 'docker.io/registry:latest' ## Fedora
            image: &registry_image 'registry:latest'
            container_name: &dvc 'registry-datastore'
            command: echo *dvc data volume container
            volumes:
              - &datapath '/registry'
          registry-service:
            image: *registry_image
            container_name: 'registry-service'
            volumes_from:
              - *dvc
            environment:
              SETTINGS_FLAVOR: 'local'
              STORAGE_PATH: *datapath
              SEARCH_BACKEND: 'sqlalchemy'
              REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY: '/registry'
            ports:
              - 127.0.0.1:5000:5000
            # restart: 'always'    # compose v1.9
            deploy:                # compose v3
              restart_policy:
                condition: on-failure
                delay: 5s
                max_attempts: 3
                window: 120s
          nginx-latest:
            # image: 'docker.io/nginx:latest'  ##Fedora
            image: 'nginx:latest'
            container_name: 'nginx-latest'
            network_mode: 'bridge'
            links:
              - 'registry-service:registry'
            ports:
              - '80:80'
              - '443:443'
            volumes:
              - /srv/docker-registry/nginx/:/etc/nginx/conf.d
              - /srv/docker-registry/auth/:/etc/nginx/conf.d/auth
              - /srv/docker-registry/certs/:/etc/nginx/conf.d/certs
            working_dir: '/var/www/html'
            volume_driver: 'local'
            userns_mode: 'host'

Then you would target a host with the following states:

.. code:: yaml

    include:
      - base: docker
      - base: docker.compose.ng

``docker.swarm``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Saltstack `swarm module` state support (See https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.swarm.html).

``docker.swarm.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Opposite of `docker.swarm` state (See https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.swarm.html).

``docker.networks``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create docker networks

``docker.networks.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remove docker networks

Notes on Raspberry Pi support
-----------------------------

There are some caveats with regard to the support of this module on Rasberry Pi 4b's.

* This module has only been tested with Raspberry Pi 4b using Rasbian Os Version Buster

* This module supports raspbian only when used from Salt 3002.6. Salt 3003.x fails with template isses.

* Docker service is known to fail starting when freshly installed via this module on Rasbian Buster with all apt-get updates and upgrades performed. The error found in logs for failing to start is :code:`dockerd: failed to create NAT chain DOCKER`
  
The Reason for this is as documented `here <https://forums.docker.com/t/failing-to-start-dockerd-failed-to-create-nat-chain-docker/78269>`_ . The following Fix followed by a restart fixes this.
The summary reason is that the docker installer uses iptables for nat. Unfortunately Debian uses nftables. You can convert the entries over to nftables or just setup Debian to use the legacy iptables.
On the target Raspberry Pi issue the following to resolve or incorporate the SLS before in your custom SLS

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
    sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
    sudo shutdown -r 0  # Do a restart, Docker.d should then function

or the following SLS

.. code-block:: yaml

    iptables:
      alternatives.set:
        - path:  /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
    ip6tables:
      alternatives.set:
        - path:  /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy

The provisioning of docker to raspbian uses functionality from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-convenience-script. It specifically mentions
Using these scripts is not recommended for production environments, and you should understand the potential risks before you use them:
The reasons are stated as :

* The scripts require root or sudo privileges to run. Therefore, you should carefully examine and audit the scripts before running them.

* The scripts attempt to detect your Linux distribution and version and configure your package management system for you. In addition, the scripts do not allow you to customize any installation parameters. This may lead to an unsupported configuration, either from Docker’s point of view or from your own organization’s guidelines and standards.

* The scripts install all dependencies and recommendations of the package manager without asking for confirmation. This may install a large number of packages, depending on the current configuration of your host machine.

* The script does not provide options to specify which version of Docker to install, and installs the latest version that is released in the “edge” channel.

* Do not use the convenience script if Docker has already been installed on the host machine using another mechanism.



Testing
-------

Linux testing is done with ``kitchen-salt``.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Ruby
* Docker

.. code-block:: bash

   $ gem install bundler
   $ bundle install
   $ bin/kitchen test [platform]

Where ``[platform]`` is the platform name defined in ``kitchen.yml``,
e.g. ``debian-9-2019-2-py3``.

``bin/kitchen converge``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates the Docker instance and runs the ``docker`` main state, ready for testing.

``bin/kitchen verify``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs the ``inspec`` tests on the actual instance.

``bin/kitchen destroy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removes the Docker instance.

``bin/kitchen test``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. ``destroy`` + ``converge`` + ``verify`` + ``destroy``.

``bin/kitchen login``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
